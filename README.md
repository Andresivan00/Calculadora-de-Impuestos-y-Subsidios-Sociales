# Tax and Subsidy Calculator
An intelligent program that simulates how the tax and subsidy system in Colombia works based on your income, age, and dependents!

### What this code does
It asks you for:

- Your full name

- Age

- Monthly salary

- How many dependents you have (children, parents, etc.)

Then it automatically tells you:

- Whether you pay taxes and how much (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 30%)

- If you receive a discount for being over 60 years old

- If you qualify for a government subsidy (tax exemption)

- The exact amount in pesos you must pay
